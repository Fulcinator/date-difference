 * @description
 * Get the number of days that overlap in two time intervals
 *
 * @param intervalLeft - the first interval to compare. See [Interval]{@link docs/Interval}
 * @param intervalRight - the second interval to compare. See [Interval]{@link docs/Interval}
 * @returns the number of days that overlap in two time intervals
 * @throws {RangeError} The start of an interval cannot be after its end
 * @throws {RangeError} Date in interval cannot be `Invalid Date`
 *
 * @example
 * // For overlapping time intervals adds 1 for each started overlapping day:
 * getOverlappingDaysInIntervals(
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 10), end: new Date(2014, 0, 20) },
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 17), end: new Date(2014, 0, 21) }
 * )
 * //=> 3
 *
 * @example
 * // For non-overlapping time intervals returns 0:
 * getOverlappingDaysInIntervals(
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 10), end: new Date(2014, 0, 20) },
 *   { start: new Date(2014, 0, 21), end: new Date(2014, 0, 22) }
 * )
 * //=> 0
